Drag-and-Drop-using-jquery
==========================

button is dragged and dropped in a particular area then it calls the function and creates chart using jchartfx
   1-> jq.html,
        is static one which drags and accepts in box
    2-> final.html,(prefered)
        which gets id value and drags and drops in box 
    3->drg_drp.jsp
        this file is used to drag drop the column name in xaxis and y axis simple validation takes place for y axis it requires only numbers 
        after dop click button it goes to drg_drp2.jsp where creation of chart takes place 
        **** dont forger to alter table db name in database and include js file in prefered path..
